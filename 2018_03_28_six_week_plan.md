# The 6 Week Plan

Well this is probably more than a 6 week plan, but the primary focus is on making this great experiment work out.

What is the great experiment you ask? Well it's simply that I decided to leave my comfortable 4-day-a-week job at Enabled to pursue Vessels Tech full time. Practically, this will look like me trying my best to make Vessels profitable in the short term, while supplementing that income with some freelancing here and there as I need it.


**Short Term:** Make enough mmoney between Vessels Tech + Freelancing to support 1 full time person. This looks like:
- Grants
- Products, Projects & Partnerships
- Freelance Work (lowest priority, but perhaps a necessary evil)

**Long Term:** Vessels Tech as a builder of successful, sustainable businesses that use technology for social impact. These startups could
- attract outside funding
- be self funded by Vessels Tech, or
- be supported by grants


However, in the **6 weeks** from mid-April until the end of May, our goal is to attract enough (1) grant funding, (2) freelance work, and (3) project support to last until the end of August.

The target is 10,000 AUD in cash or accounts receivable due by August.


## Principles

- Pursue a deep work mentality. If this thing is going to work, we need to maximise our focus and ability to output
- Favour partnerships over solo-ships, even if it means dividing funding by 2. 10,000 AUD is not too lofty a goal that partnerships will take this from us
