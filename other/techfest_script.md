## Hydroit by No Pain, No Crane
### Combining the power of Hyralix with the power of IOT


## Problem

- Imagine you run a car rental company - with one caveat: you have no idea of knowing your customers are abusing your cars: crashing them, ___, or ___.

While it sounds absurd, this is the very challenge faced in the machine hire industry. Your users often abuse the hydralics systems [insert examples], and you have no real way of knowing what damage they are doing to your machines.

Not only this, but your user isn't even incentivised to do the right thing - either safety wise or in exceedig the operaational capacities of your machines.


 
[- Imagine you run a heavy machinery hire company. You have a fleet of 100 or more cranes, bobcats, diggers, drills - all powered with Hawe Hydralics.

- Managing this fleet is a difficult task - you don't know when a machine may break down and need maintainence, causing you a considerable cost.

- Your users have no incentive to treat your machinery well - plus you have no insights into how your machines are being used. Are they being used for the wrong purpose? Are your users using them beyond their rated limits?]


## Opportunity
- Hydra IOT is an integrated system for monitoring the usage and abuse of hydraulic systems in heavy machinery. 

## Solution
- We integrate our sensors with Hawe hydraulics, either retrofitting existing units or including them in new products sold. This includes pressure and temperatures (which are already used for internal hyrdalic systems), as well as accelerometor and temperature sensors.

- Using a 3G or satellite connection, we push these data to our platform in near real time
- We then perform data analytics and machine learning to see how the machines are being used.

## What it does

Alert owners when a machine reports a fault, or a user abuses it- Allow cost savings: 	- leasers can be billed per use, and receive discounts for safe usage

- we then enable:

  - Alert the owner when a hired machine reports a fault or a user abuses the machine
  - Billing users per use instead of per day or hour. More heavy use results in a higher bill, plus our platform enables retailers to offer discounts for the safe and correct use of their machines
  - Finally, once we get to know a machine and fleet, we can start to predict maintainence cycles, and integrate with hire company's existing ERP systems, to help them optimize their usage and maintainence.


- Alerts the owner when the user overuses or abuses the machine
- Allows for more granular billing: users save money for using machines properly, or pay a premium for misusing the machine
- Integrates with leaser’s ERP systems: enables leaser to perform predictive maintenance and optimize their fleet’s usage


## Cost/Benefit

- for a 30 year lifecycle of a machine
- 400,000 USD
- average hire cost of:
- average repair cost on hydralics systems over it's lifetime 
- we estimate a 25% reduction at: 


Now multiply this by the number of machines, and 


[cost? quantify value?]


## Demo

Let's see a demo of our system in action.

Here we have our heavy machine, powered by Have hydralics. For the purposes of this demo, we have integrated our accelerometor and tip detection system, but you can imagine adding hydralic pressure and temperature sensors to be able to monitor more aspects of this machine.

And here is the dashboard, which we will display to the user hiring out the machine (or their manager), as well as the owner of the machine.

As you can see, when we use the machine under normal operations, our sensors collect data, and display it's utilization, as well as the current bill, which is calculated based on usage. 

Let's say we over use the hydralics on this machine. 
First of all, before doing anything, the user is alerted through this blinking LED that they are close to reaching the usage threshold. If the user continues, it sends an alert, which displays in the dashboard, and the user is penalized - as you can see, the price has gone up.

What about if the user tips over the machine - our sensors detect the unsafe use of the machine, and send an alert to the owner.


## Future

For this hackathon, we focused mainly on the renting of heavy machinery, but there's a lot of potential for this system:

- Hawe and manufacturers using Hawe products have little insight into how their machines are being used in the real world. These data can be fed back into the R&D cycle to better design and test these hydralics based on real world data.
- As I said earlier, these machines can be a 20-30 year investment, and when reselling, they can be difficult to assess the value. Now with Hydroit, resellers can better prove the value of their machines, based on the usage data over the lifetime ...
- Hawe can now build new business by offering resale warantees - since we have the data for the use of a hydralics system's lifetime along with the repair and maintanence data, Hawe can certify their products for resale and build an additional revenue stream from the reselling of their products.
