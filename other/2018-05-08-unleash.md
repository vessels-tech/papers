I don't know about you, but I find myself a subscriber of herd-mentality thinking. I don't mean the "I'll just follow the leader" sheep-ish way of looking at the world, I mean the "when we come together, the net result of those ideas is greater than the sum of it's parts". So like penguins huddling together for warmth, or schools of fish evading the largest predators, when we bring our ideas together, we go much further than when we were alone.

Which is why I'm so excited to have been selected as an Innovator at Unleash 2018 in Singapore. What is [Unleash](https://unleash.org)? Unleash is an innovation lab, which brings together 1000 people together to incubate ideas for solving the world's toughest problems. It's a great opportunity for myself - as someone passionate about bringing technology and people together to improve lives, and it's a great opportunity for my company Vessels Tech - as we decide where to next invest our efforts.

Moreover, I'm looking forward to meeting new people from around the world, learning about the challenges they see and face, and sharing ideas on how we might be able to solve them. I'm also really looking forward to the challenge (I do love challenges) of developing concrete business models for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in just a week (the business models that is, not the developmeng goals).


## What do we hope to achieve

There's 4 key objectives that I hope to achieve in my time in Singapore:

1. I want to come away with a new business idea for sustainable projects in our areas of interest, likely around Sustainable Development Goals 6 & 7. Ultimately, I'd love to start a new business, or project under my existing business out of this.

2. I hope to pick up new skills, and gain experience from the Innovation Lab, where I'm challenged to iterate on ideas and come up with solutions. Fast.

3. I look forward to meeting with like-minded individuals, experienced veterans of this space and investors. I'm sure I will be inspired by their journeys and insights.

4. I hope to eat lots of chicken rice. Lots. Of. Chicken. Rice. 



I've got only a few weeks to go now until I fly out to Singapore. I wanted to say thanks for Unleash for having me along, and I look forward to it!
