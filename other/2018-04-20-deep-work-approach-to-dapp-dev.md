My Deep Work Approach to Becoming an Eth dApp Expert

Goal: become a proficent dApp developer in 1 week
Background: Software developer for 8 or so years. Working as an SRE, Back end web, some data analytics and deep learning

Inspired by Cal Newport’s Deep Learning, specifically the story of Jason Benn, who managed to learn sofware development froms scratch in 2 months or so. 


“Highlight the programming textbooks, transfer the ideas to notecards, and practice them out loud”
What’s the equivalent for us?

>Not sure, it seems that most of the ways to learn this stuff is through tutorials.

Perhaps we can have a dedicated reading and note taking time (maybe the entire first day + start of each day the rest of the week)

> download all reading resources to the iPad, and sit in a room with the iPad all day.

Day 4: Application

- Design, Build & Deploy a Decentralized AirBnb from scratch
    - uses multiple contracts
    - hosted on IPFS
- Build on chain/off chain application?


Day 5: Next Steps

- Read the Eth + IPFS white papers again. 
- Come up with new ideas
    - what can we build that helps making this process easier?
    - what can we build that leverages this technology?
