## Questions:
- What exactly is urban farming?
- can it really be sustainable? How much can urban farms provide for an entire city?

  - Don't traditional farms have much better economies of scale?
    - how might we get economies of scale to urban farms?




## Readings

### Urban agriculture for sustainable cities: using wastes and idle land and water bodies as resources

- need to close the "open loop" of cities, which import goods, and dispose of waste
- "Large Chinese cities produce 90% and more of their vegetable requirement within urban regions"
- Potential to use Urban wastes as resources

- Urban Agriculture a necessity for sustainable development
  - More than 50% of the world's population moving into urban areas and growing
  - urban agriculture most efficent tool for transforming urban wastes into food and jobs
  - high labour, low capital, low skill. excellent for low-income households and jobs


### Big Data Suggests Big Potential for Urban Farming 
ref: https://www.citylab.com/environment/2018/02/big-data-suggests-big-potential-for-urban-farming/552770/


- urban farming will not solve 
- "food miles" not that big a deal, especially compared to less efficent growing of urban agriculture
- only 1 in 3 urban farmers made a living in US (https://www.citylab.com/life/2016/03/urban-farming-financial-viability-survey/471756/)
- potential for urban agriculture to contribute several percent to global food production
- other externalities produced by urban agriculture, known as "ecosystem services"
  - "fully-realized urban agriculture could provide as much as 15 billion kilowatt hours of annual energy savings worldwide"
  - "It could also sequester up to 170,000 tons of nitrogen and prevent as much as 57 billion cubic meters of stormwater runoff, a major source of pollution in rivers and streams."

idea: considering urban ag in city planning, the Google Maps study released their code open source.




### The Future of Food: Are You Ready for the Millennials?

- Millenials trust small and local
  - our solution enables small and local farmers make a living

- Millenials pay a premium for quality
  - including sustainably sourced food


I wonder if we can draw a comparison between Uber allowing people to have part time jobs or temporary jobs and what our system will allow urban famers...



### Micro-farming on Rented Land: Curtis Stone Interview
ref: https://www.milkwood.net/2015/10/02/micro-farming-on-rented-land-curtis-stone-interview/

- land improvements an issue
  - if the land needs major soil remediation, growers would want a 5-10 year lease agreement, otherwise the capital expenses required to fix the soil would make it too expensive

- Access to market is a real key for this guy
  - no trouble selling goods, and cost of doing so is very low
    - in this manner, urban farmer are competitive with smaller farms, but not with large scale farms that already have distribution figured out

- decentralised farming (physically) is great for diversifying risk.
  - eg. If you have 5 plots across a city, and three get hit with Hail, then you still have 2 good ones!

- Singapore has a program for indivduals wanting to grow greens for themselves and their families
- Pocket Greens, an urban farm in Singapore rents out racks for people to grow microgreens such as brocolli or kale, which take up small space


### Secure Land for Urban Agriculture: Developing models of secure tenure for urban community farms and gardens
ref: http://equitytrust.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Secure-Land-for-Urban-Agriculture-report-June-2015.pdf

- many urban ag programs lack security of tenure or access to sufficent land
  - People don't want to put effort (and money) into improving land or building infrastructure to increase yields as they aren't guaranteed the land in long term lease arrangements


From interviews of urban farmers: (n=25)
- 16 faced insecure tenure
- urban famers faced issues moving on from incubation sites as they can't find land
- 7 cannot build infrastructure, either because they don't have secure tenure or are unable to get permission to build


## Ideas
- Decentralized AirBnb for urban farms


- selling stuff to wannabe urban farmers
