## Description __5_mins__
- What is MyWell
  - Technology component of MARVI
  - Crowdsources well information from many people
    - Give people ownership (no longer just scientists coming in - the villagers are the scientists)
  - Smartphone and SMS app for tracking well readings, among other things
    - Currrently, readings are being taken by hand for 10 villages. This obviously doesn't scale!
      - more robust system
      - scaleable system
      - better visualisations
    - IT to the rescue (and enter Lewis)

    - BJ's can also add new 'resources', by inputting a few details, such as LatLng,
