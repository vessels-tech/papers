## Introduction

Thank you Professor Basant, and thank you to Ice Warm for having me here today.
As Professor Basant said, my name is Lewis, and I will be sharing on my work within Project MARVI - that of MyWell. 
MyWell is an application that enables farmers to crowdsource groundwater levels.

Before I go into that, however, I wanted to give you a brief background about myself, and my company, Vessels Tech.

## Vessels

Vessels Tech is a tech company that builds technology solutions for emerging markets. We're a small team that grew out of this opportunity with MARVI, and we are working on various technology projects in both India and the Philippines.

We're passionate about building technology for social impact, and the opportunity we've had with project MARVI and MyWell has been really fun and exciting for us.

## MyWell

## What is MyWell

- We see MyWell as the technology component of project MARVI
- It is an application that enables farmers to crowdsource groundwater data.
- It allows farmers to participate in a network of data collectors, and empowers them to understand the science behind their water, and actively be a part of the solution

## 3 Step Process

The overall process for MyWell to improve the groundwater situation can be broken down into 3 parts:

1. Farmers go and collect groundwater data. This can be rainfall measurements, well watertable depths and so on
2. MyWell aggregates these data and provides information and insights into the groundwater situation
3. This information is disseminated to farmers, villages and groundwater cooperatives - leading to an improved understanding of groundwater, and better groundwater conservation


## What can it do?

- Works just about anywhere: smartphone + feature phone application 
- Records well readings, rainfall levels, and checkdam readings
- We're working on including water quality readings as well, to complete the groundwater picture


## Features

In leiu of a demo, I'm going to talk through a variety of MyWell's features. I'll be showing you the phone interface view, but keep in mind most of these features are available over SMS and also the MyWell website.

## Historical Readings

## Reporting

## Management

## Technology

Now this is the exiting part for me, so I could likely talk to you for hours about it. Instead of doing that, I'm going to highlight 3 key features of how MyWell works:

1. It's super modular, build with what we call a 'microservices approach'. This means MyWell can be re-configured, scaled up, and new components can be added on easily.
2. It integrates with SMS providers. Both in India and Australia, with more to be added once we expand to other regions
3. MyWell is hosted in Amazon Web Services. That gives us a secure database that is backed up by the hour or even minute. 


## Impact

There's three key points that I want to highlight where we see MyWell having impact, and the potential for MyWell to impact the lives of these farmers in the future.

## MyWell empowers farmers to be a part of the solution

No longer does groundwater reseach happen by scientists with degrees; it's now the everyday farmer who is armed with tools and information to help them support and engage in groundwater research and intervention.

## MyWell helps build groundwater sharing within communities

By giving greater visibility and understanding of groundwater, communities can come together to share.

## MyWell helps visualize this invisible resouce

Really, that is one of the key outcomes for what we want to achive with MyWell.

## Results

These are some of the early findings we've seen from using MyWell on the ground.

## Field Trials + Workshop

I was lucky enough to travel to Megraj and Dharta villages earlier this year with some of the MARVI team.

We ran field trials, gave demos of MyWell in action in workshops, and surveyed 15 BJs about their opinion of using MyWell. In our field trials we went out to a well and recorded a reading (as you can see in the photo), and also got BJs to submit well readings from some paper recordings they had made in the last couple weeks.

This was a great opportunity for us to teach the BJs about MyWell, but also be taught about the ways they interact with technology, and the areas where we can improve MyWell.


## Results

From these surveys, and the conversations we had while watching BJs use MyWell, we came away with the following points:

On the good side;
- BJs noted how MyWell can be used to make their jobs easier and more accurate
- They saw the potential for how this technology could help with crop planning, and understanding their water needs
- They trusted MyWell inherently, (good, but we need to respect and not lose that trust) and loved that the data in MyWell is both secure (it's not going anywhere soon), and accessible

The three main points about MyWell which can be improved are:
- We need to translate MyWell into Hindi - it's been on the todo list for a long time, and this workshop really drove home how important it is to get this done
- It was difficult to read the graphs inside of MyWell, especially on android phones with small screens. We need to work on ways to make these more accessible, especially to people who aren't used to reading graphs every day.
- Finally, there were some minor user interface bugs, which to us might seem trivial, but when we saw the BJs using them, with low technology literacy, they were much more apparent, and in some cases deal breakers for making MyWell usable


## Next Steps

So what's next for us?

## Next Steps: Short Term

In the short term, we're focusing on those translations as I said, as well as improvements to the user interface and user experience

We're also going to trial out an idea that came out of the workshops with using QR codes to identify wells, rain gauges and checkdams. Instead of users having to remember a string of numbers or a location to identify a well, the user can simply scan a qr code (much like PayTM), reducing the number of fields to be filled out from 4 down to 1 or 2. This will hopefully also reduce the likelyhood of farmers entering fake or incorrect readings, as they have to be at the well to make these readings.

Finally, we're working on a set of tools to make MyWell more accessible to researchers. Among others, we have a researcher from Flinders University who is trialling MyWell in Laos, and we want to make it possible and easy to adapt this from india to other places.

## Next Steps: Long Term

Longer term, we're interested in pursuing partnerships and integrations. This is really the future we see for MyWell, to become a useful tool for Groundwater conservation projects and citizen engagement around the world. 

We're already working on an integration with the International Groundwater Resources Assessment Centre in the Netherlands, and this is my chance  to say: please get in touch if you're interested in partnering or integrating with our platform.

Sharing of scarce resources is not a problem unique to groundwater, and we're hoping to adapt MyWell and the MARVI approach to other projects where engaging local citizens in being part of the solution to coordinate and share resources is key.

Finally, we've had talks with a number of parties about building out an Open Water Data Platform. If you don't know much about Open Data, it's an initiative much like open source software or open access journals: institutions can freely publish data, and access eachothers data. We would love to see a platform where organisations who are involved in groundwater research can collaborate and share their water data, reducing the amount of institutional silos, and hopefully enabling more learning from each other and application of different ideas and innovations.


## Thanks for tuning in

So thanks for tuning in, and thanks once again to Ice Warm for having me present about MyWell. These are my details if you want to get in touch.


## Final slide

I'll hand back over to Professor Basant, thanks.
