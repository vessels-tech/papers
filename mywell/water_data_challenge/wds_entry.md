## What do you call your Innovation?
MyWell

## Choose an image for your Innovation.
__TODO__

## How do you describe it to others?
MyWell provides a data-driven approach to groundwater management.

MyWell crowdsources groundwater data from a network of volunteers. ​ The data is collected and aggregated to give a picture of the groundwater situation at a village level. MyWell gives ownership of the groundwater situation to the villagers, and aims to facilitate change in groundwater use at a village level.

## Provide a status update for your Innovation.
We have just released version 1.3.0 of MyWell, bringing in full support of checkdams and rainfall stations! This gives visibility of vital resources that are valuable in understanding the groundwater situation.


## What is your innovation's value proposition?

*We’re looking for innovations that are sustainable (financial, institutional, environmental, technological, and social); use participatory and context-specific processes; are scalable in resource-poor settings; and that can be monitored and evaluated for impact and learning. In your application (Step 2), please be sure to note how your innovation addresses one or more of the three breakthrough areas.*

MyWell is a **Water Data Solution**. MyWell gathers data and provides information about the groundwater situation to farmers at a village level. Relying on a network of connected volunteers and their mobile phones, MyWell is cost effective and highly scalable.

MyWell aims to bring about institutional change at the village level. Groundwater is becoming more scarce, and suffers from the tragedy of the commons. There needs to be community approaches to sharing groundwater for the livelihoods of farmers to continue. In this way, MyWell can also be considered a **Water Data Investment**.

MyWell encourages and facilitates a participatory approach to groundwater management. While already in a piloting phase in India, MyWell's processes are replicable. This means we can apply MyWell anywhere in the world, and to many other systems where scarce resources need to be shared in a community.

monitored and evaluated for impact and learning???

Its processes are scalable or something?

MyWell

- Giving farmers more visibility of their well data, in order to improve the visibility of groundwater
- Empowering everyday citizens to be involved in science, collecting data for their own use, and the use of their communities.
- Helping to bring together people around the issues of groundwater, and build communities to make a difference.

## How does your innovation work?
### (What are the technical details behind how your innovation works? Or describe how your process makes things more effective.)

MyWell is a Smartphone and SMS app for tracking and understanding groundwater. The app works by crowdsourcing well, rainfall and checkdam readings a network of volunteers. MyWell displays the current status of each well, as well as historical and village level data for simple comparison and analysis.

When a volunteer takes a reading from a well, rainfall station or checkdam, they can use MyWell to submit it immediately. Either with a Smartphone or over SMS, all they need to do is fill in a simple form. This eliminates the need to use paper based systems, and allows for immediate feedback for the farmers relying on MyWell. Once a volunteer saves a reading in the MyWell, anyone in the network can access it at a later date for statistics and data analysis.

Network of farmers can then use MyWell to get updates on their well, see the village's average reading, and compare their well's status with the last 2 years. MyWell now also captures rainfall and checkdam data, giving a clearer picture of the groundwater situation at the village level.

## What is your strategy for expanding use of your innovation?
1. Prove its value in a small number of villages
2. Gather feedback from pilot phase
3. Train volunteers in registering new wells, and allow them to train others in order to grow the MyWell network

## Next Steps
We are currently holding a demo and evaluation in Ahmedabad, India. This evaluation targets stakeholders from multiple levels, from State Governments, local NGOs, and farmers and villagers on the ground. This feedback will give us a good indication on how well it meets the needs, and feedback on what features we should be focusing on next.

Next, we will extend this evaluation to a network of 200 volunteers with rain gauges. Over the next 2-3 weeks, we will see how effective MyWell is at crowdsourcing on this scale. Such an evaluation will include some accuracy measures, ...

We are in early talks of using MyWell in other countries. Once we have good feedback, and have worked out any pain points with our evaluations, we aim to scale up MyWell in both India and internationally.

*Notes*
Please note: to be considered for the Challenge, you must add your innovation to the Exchange and select the Water Data Challenge under "related programs."



Really hone in on this:
To identify, develop and test data-led, highly cost-effective solutions, which satisfy the information needs of farmers—male and female, or the extension agents who support farmers, to reduce farmer’s water-related risks and costs.
