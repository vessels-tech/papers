## An App for Monitoring Groundwater Levels, Rainfall, Water Quality and Water in Checkdams at the Village Level

## About MyWell

MyWell is a Smartphone and SMS App for tracking wells in MARVI. The App works by crowdsourcing well, rainfall and checkdam readings from MARVI's network of BJs. MyWell displays the current status of each well, as well as historical and village level data for simple comparison and analysis.

## MyWell approach
- Engage farmers, schools and local communities in groundwater monitoring;
- Help in easy collection on and availability of groundwater data across India; and
- Visualise groundwater data and empower farmers to self-manage groundwater sustainably at the village and Gram Panchayat levels.

## Why involve people?
Decisions regarding the sustainable management of groundwater should be based on objective science, and that by connecting farmers and local community members with hands-on monitoring opportunities we can begin a village level movement for groundwater security and produce and empower local groundwater champions.

Since 2012, MARVI project team has worked in Rajasthan and Gujarat with farmers, schools and others in the village community to develop village level groundwater monitoring approach. The idea of Bhujal Jankaar (BJ) was developed to assist in monitoring of groundwater levels around villages, collecting local data and developing a scientific understanding of groundwater dynamics. The data collected by BJs can inform sound decision-making about the sustainable management of groundwater.

Our aim is to demystify groundwater science at the village level and make it accessible to villagers, government agencies and NGOs, while ensuring that it is cost-effective, evidence-based and helps to assess the groundwater situation at village level and beyond. The unique approach used here through MyWell App provides villagers the opportunity to work alongside researchers and government agencies to collect local data and make them available for themselves and others.

The data collected through MyWell are critical to build our understanding of how the groundwater levels fluctuate during the monsoon and other times of the year when pumping is in full swing. Also, the local data collected this way can help to understand how pumping impacts the groundwater situation at the village and inform sound decision-making about the management of groundwater.

Involving villagers for groundwater monitoring enables them to make a direct contribution to scientific research in their village, gain new insights based actual data, and learn about a way to cope with groundwater scarcity. Also, involving villagers in groundwater monitoring provide immersive experiences that can help challenge current groundwater management practices.

## How does the MyWell App work?
When a BJ takes a reading from a well, rainfall station or checkdam, they can use MyWell to submit it immediately. Either with a Smartphone or over SMS, all they need to do is fill in a simple form. This eliminates the need to use paper based systems, and allows for immediate feedback for the farmers relying on MyWell. Once a BJ saves a reading in the MyWell system, other MyWell users can access it at a later date for statistics and data analysis.

## Management
MyWell App is available for use on both Android and iOS platforms. The App has a host of tools for BJs to manage the MyWell system. BJs can register a new Well, Rainfall Station and Checkdam - using their device's
inbuilt GPS to pinpoint the location.

MyWell also has a 'Banner Image' feature. Each well can have a unique Banner Image - usually of the well and farmer - allowing for greater personalisation and attractiveness to farmers.

Finally, MyWell allows users to upload a large number of readings at a time. This allows an import of large amounts of historical data; increasing the immediate value of MyWell to the farmers.

## Next Steps for MyWell
In the next phase, MyWell will be scaled from 10 to 100 villages, then onto several orders of magnitude larger. This means making improvements to the features that make up the self-managed MyWell network. MyWell's analytics and visualisation features will be improved to allow for be er groundwater visibility for farmers. This will also help cater to the science and research aspects of MyWell and MARVI as a whole.

As far as App features go, MyWell needs to learn a few new languages; especially Hindi, Gujarati  and Marathi. The SMS features of MyWell are targeted for improvement - with modern Chatbot and AI technologies. The goal is to make interacting with MyWell over SMS easier and more conversational.
