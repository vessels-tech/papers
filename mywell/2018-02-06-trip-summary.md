## What did we do?

We ran MyWell workshops with BJs (groundwater monitoring volunteers) in both the Dharta and Megraj watersheds. These workshops involved demonstrating to BJs both MyWell on Android and MyWell over SMS.

We also conducted field trials where BJs uploaded well readings in real time, and we were able to see them on other devices.

We surveyed the BJs in attendance, along with researchers involved in the MARVI project learn their feedback on things that worked, didn't work, and areas where they think MyWell could expand and grow.


## What did we learn?

There are many minor UI/UX improvements that need to be done. Users who were unfamilar with the interface found it a little confusing, and needed some help the first time. 

Once they had learned the interface, they seemed to pick it up more quickly, and were able to navigate around mywell with relative ease, however there were a few minor issues that turned out to be major in practice (eg. selecting the country code)

Since the first field trials run with MyWell, the 3G/4G network coverage has improved, making it
