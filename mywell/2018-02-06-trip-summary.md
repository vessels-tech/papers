# MyWell Jan 18 Trip Summary

Over two days in early January, we ventured out to run workshops and conduct field trials of MyWell. Apart from flying kites (apparently a tradition in Gujarat on the 14th) and ___ we had a great time teaching BJs about MyWell, and learning from their experiences.

__note__: This is what yen thinks

## What did we do?

We ran MyWell workshops with BJs (groundwater monitoring volunteers) in both the Dharta and Megraj watersheds. These workshops involved demonstrating to BJs both MyWell on Android and MyWell over SMS.

We also conducted field trials where BJs uploaded well readings in real time, and we were able to see them on other devices.

We surveyed the BJs in attendance, along with researchers involved in the MARVI project learn their feedback on things that worked, didn't work, and areas where they think MyWell could expand and grow.


## What did we learn?

There are many minor UI/UX improvements that need to be done. Users who were unfamilar with the interface found it a little confusing, and needed some help the first time. 

Once they had learned the interface, they seemed to pick it up more quickly, and were able to navigate around mywell with relative ease, however there were a few minor issues that turned out to be major in practice (eg. selecting the country code)

Since the first field trials run with MyWell, the 3G/4G network coverage has improved, making it easier to use in the field. Additionally, the ability to save readings offline was still important, and was a key feature to both BJs and researchers.

Unfortunately, the MyWell SMS provider had stopped working only days earlier - and since we were in a holiday period in India, we were not able to get this working on the day. We did still demonstrate MyWell's features over SMS to the BJs, but we were not able to demonstrate a full end to end test.

There were a number of different coding schemes being used across the MARVI project to identify wells, checkdams and raingauges - which added another hurdle to the BJs.

At one stage in the Megraj workshop, we had to refer to a paper based list of wells to figure out which was the right one to record a reading for!



## Feedback

### Feedback from BJs:

#### Good
- using mywell will lead to less errors, reduces the need to use paper, and makes recording readings faster
- MyWell was quick and easy to understand
- the mywell data is secure and shareable with anyone


#### Needs improvement
- Needs a Hindi version (just about everyone said this)
- want to be able to record water quality data
- data should be easy to download (this feature already exists, only not on mobile!)


#### Used for:
- Water and rainfall monitoring
- Developing an understanding of the water needs of a household and farm
- Information from MyWell can help to quantify the water in their well to know how much
- helps with crop planning



All BJs identified MyWell as a viable source of well information in the future





- quick to offer suggestions, like integration with WhatsApp

Favourite feedback (although not all that helpful):
>There should be a good music come from background while using MyWell App. There should be 1 GB free data for users.







## Next Steps

These workshops and field trials are a vital step in progressing the development of MyWell.

As we keep on talking with other groundwater organisations about integrating MyWell, this trip was a good reminder of the minor issues that will affect the end user in a major way. Improvements to MyWell Android and MyWell SMS need to always take this into consideration.

One key improvement that we are working towards is making it easier to identify wells using a simple QR code attached to the pump or near the well - this will take an extra hurdle of BJs who manage readings for multiple wells, and help ensure the accuracy of data.

Curiously, this approach seems more and more popular in India with the rise of apps like PayTM.
