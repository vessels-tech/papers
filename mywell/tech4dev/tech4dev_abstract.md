**Abstract:**

Across India, over 60% of agriculture relies on groundwater. Groundwater is often over-exploited, and groundwater depletion threatens many livelihoods. Existing interventions have been insufficient, and often fail to engage farmers at the lowest level. MyWell sets out to build a participatory, bottom-up approach to groundwater management. MyWell is an application for data-driven insights of groundwater at the village level. MyWell crowdsources groundwater indicators from a group of connected farmers using SMS or a smartphone application. In this paper, we show how MyWell has the potential to impact the lives of farmers by (1) empowering them to participate in science, and finding solutions to groundwater scarcity, and (2) assist them in building communities which work together to conserve groundwater. Then, we assess MyWell's application across two watersheds in rural India. We show how farmers are using MyWell to gain visibility into the groundwater situation, and examine the limitations of MyWell's approach.

**Extended Abstract**

Background

India uses the largest amount of groundwater in the world, estimated at 230 cubic kilometers per year, more than 25% of the global total (World Bank, 2010). A cheap and accessible resource, groundwater is often over exploited for food production, with rainfall insufficient to recharge the groundwater levels (Rathore, 2004).

Groundwater is fundamental to the livelihoods of many farmers across India. In rural India, over 60 percent of agriculture is dependent on groundwater irrigation (World Bank, 2010). Groundwater allows farmers to grow crops in the dry season and manage deficiencies in monsoonal rainfall, contributing to improved livelihoods and poverty alleviation (Maheshwari et al, 2014).

To ensure the future livelihoods of these farmers, intervention is required. Many existing intervention approaches are top-down; policy makers and researchers with a clear view of watershed-level issues instruct farmers to use less water. With these approaches, farmers are often left out of the conversation, and aren't able to engage in groundwater management. MyWell, within the scope of a larger project MARVI - Managed Aquifer Recharge for Village level Intervention - set out to build participatory approaches for groundwater management from the bottom, the farmers and villages themselves.


MyWell

MyWell is a smartphone and SMS application for crowdsourcing groundwater, rainfall, water quality and checkdam water levels in rural India. Farmers armed with a smartphone or feature phone can participate in a network of connected farmers who collect information, and glean insights into the groundwater situation.

Farmers record readings on Android or iOS devices using the MyWell app, or over SMS for those without smartphones or in poor coverage areas.

MyWell can able to provide valuable data-driven insights into the groundwater situation. MyWell displays simple graphs; snapshots of the readings from a Well, Raingauge or Checkdam over the last 3 years.  MyWell also calculates village level statistics. These tools allow farmers to compare and benchmark their wells against each other, and previous years.

MyWell also has a host of tools for farmers to manage the MyWell system. Farmers can register a new Well, Rainfall Station or Checkdam - using their device's inbuilt GPS to pinpoint the location. Each well also has a unique Banner Image - usually of the well and well's owner -  allowing for greater personalization and buy-in at the village level.

Impact

MyWell has the potential to impact the livelihoods of farmers across a variety of areas.

We see the greatest potential in MyWell for empowering smallholder farmers to be actively involved in science through data collection, and to be a part of the solution to groundwater scarcity.

MyWell also allows communities of farmers to make data-driven decisions about using groundwater. In the short term, these communities will allow for more efficient allocation of water (ie. so crops won't fail). Long term, MyWell provides a platform for taking steps towards ensuring the future of water security.

MyWell is a tool for helping build communities around the need to share groundwater. While not a solution in and of itself, we see MyWell as an instrument that can be used to facilitate conversations about groundwater.


Results

This case study evaluates MyWell's implementation in the Meghraj and Dharta watersheds in two Indian states, Gujarat and Rajasthan respectively.

We show that MyWell can be used from feature and smartphones, and allow farmers to crowdsource well, rainfall and checkdam readings, and access the data-driven insights into the groundwater situation.

We also show how the potential for MyWell to empower smallholder farmers and villages to contribute to science, and be actively involved seeking village-led solutions to groundwater scarcity.

We see limitations in what MyWell - as a technological tool - can do alone, and show how technology facilitating groundwater intervention must exist within a larger program targeting social and economic aspects of groundwater management.

Future

While this study evaluates MyWell's use in 2 watersheds in rural India, MyWell is not limited to these places, or even India. Future research and applications of MyWell will translate this approach to other countries, with differing groundwater situations.

The value of data collected by MyWell also has considerable network effects. Increasing the number of wells and watersheds monitored by MyWell will increase the value of information delivered by MyWell. The more insights to be gained from MyWell, the more valuable the information gathered is, and the more insights for data-driven action it can deliver across multiple stakeholder levels.

MyWell's primary target is smallholder farmers, but the insights it delivers can be applied across many levels of groundwater management, from researchers to policy makers. We would see MyWell expand its features and integrations with other platforms, to allow for other groundwater stakeholders to glean insights from MyWell.
