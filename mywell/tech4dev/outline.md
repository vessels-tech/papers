# Tech4Dev Presentation Outline

Data Driven Farming For Everyone

```
- 15 minute presentation
- 25-30 min panel Q+A

(i) what was the problem, 
(ii) how you dealt with it,
(iii) what you achieved and if possible lessons learned.
```

**Purpose**

- Highlight that data is power (audience already knows this)
- Introduce the MARVI/MyWell Approach
- Show the potential for using this technology to empower farmers to participate in science, and be a part of a groundwater solutions (should use the word inclusive)
- Introduce the idea of VGCs and show how MyWell can be used to help form, manage and scale them.

## Groundwater Story

- Tell a story about an individual facing groundwater scarcity, and farmers not listening to scientists, or really just highlight the disconnect here.
>Maybe ask Basant for some examples

- short introduction to mywell

## Restate the problem

- India uses the largest amount of groundwater in the world, estimated at 230 cubic kilometers per year, more than 25% of the global total (World Bank, 2010)
- Groundwater suffers from the tragedy of the commons. A cheap and accessible resource, groundwater is often over exploited for food production, with rainfall insufficient to recharge the groundwater levels (Rathore, 2004)

- There needs to be new types of groundwater intevention. 
  - Existing interventions are top-down
  - MARVI - Managed Aquifer Recharge for Village level Intervention - sets out to build a bottom up, also called participatory, approach.


## Introduce MyWell

- MyWell is a smartphone and SMS application for crowdsourcing groundwater, rainfall, water quality and checkdam water levels in rural India. 
- Farmers armed with a smartphone or feature phone can participate in a network of connected farmers who collect information, and glean insights into the groundwater situation.

Farmers record readings on Android or iOS devices using the MyWell app, or over SMS for those without smartphones or in poor coverage areas.

- MyWell is able to provide valuable data-driven insights into the groundwater situation. 
- MyWell displays simple graphs; snapshots of the readings from a Well, Raingauge or Checkdam over the last 3 years.
- MyWell also calculates village level statistics. These tools allow farmers to compare and benchmark their wells against each other, and previous years.

- MyWell also has a host of tools for farmers to manage the MyWell system, such as registering a new Well, Rainfall Station or Checkdam, or customizing their own well with a banner image.

## Impact

What is the desired impact of this tool?


- empowering smallholder farmers to be a part of science through data collection, simple analysis, and part of the groundwater scarcity solution
  - If data is power, we are making these farmers the most knowledgeable, and hence the most powerful players in the field: this is a reversal of the typical social heirarchy of farmers in India

- Allows communities to come together and make data-driven decisions about their groundwater use.
  - Short term: allow for more efficent allocation of water
  - Long Term: The beginning of a platform for taking steps towards ensuring the future of water security for these communities and beyond

- Facilitate conversations about groundwater

- All of a sudden, instead of a farmer getting advice from scientists or academics to assist them with their groundwater, their peers, the people they have known for a long time - maybe even their family members - are the ones helping and instructing them


## Results

- Ran workshops in Gujarat + Rajasthan

[images]

- Demonstrated a working application smartphone application. BJs were able to crowdsource well, rainfall and checkdam readings, and learned how to use the app pretty fast.
- Had some issues with the SMS provider on the day, so we were unable to demonstrate that. 
- Other Results?


## Lessons Learned

- Technology in and of itself it quite limited. In order for interventions like these to succeed, we need to also target the socioeconomic challenges of groundwater management

- Let's not overlook the subject of our interventions.
  - What I mean here is that as technologist, we could opt for a highly automated, more accurate and reliable system. But that would defeat the purpose. 
  - What would it look like if we involved and empowered more people through our work, ... [finish thought]

- Be Patient
  - I say this coming from a software engineering background. If a project is 6 months old, then it is boring, and if it doesn't have many users, then it is failed. The 'silicon valley' mentality says move on to the next project, but projects like this take time to grow, to get funding, 
  - I probably also say this more for the software engineers in the room than anyone else!

## Next Steps

- Want to see the MyWell approach adopted elsewhere - both scaled up in India, other countries, and other shared scare resources that suffer the same challenges as groundwater
  - already doing a pilot in Laos
  - looking for other areas to apply!
- Scale out both MyWell and MyWell data - making it more valuable to multiple stakeholders
- Integrate with other groundwater monitoring platforms.
