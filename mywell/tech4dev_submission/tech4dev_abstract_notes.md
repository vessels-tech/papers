>Data-Driven Farming For Everyone

>Emphasise:
>- Data Driven
>- Everyone (smallholder farmers, researchers etc.)

> Extended abstracts should emphasize the value of technological innovation while also acknowledging the limits of technology in generating inclusive social and economic development.

Social development: building communities
Economic development: empowering farmers with insights, tools and responsibility

## Case study objectives and outcomes:

**Objective:** To demonstrate that MyWell can be used at multiple levels to allow for a better groundwater understanding. To show how MyWell empowers low level stakeholders to be a part of citizen science, and actively involved in a solution to the groundwater problem.

**Outcomes:** Demonstrated that MyWell does what it says? ...

- Crowdsourcing and citizen science
- groundwater scarcity is bad
  - suffers the tradgedy of the commons
- MyWell is an application which enables farmers, ___ and other stakeholders to monitor groundwater levels.
- With MyWell, small holder farmers are able to see a clear picture
- This technology was applied in 2 watersheds in west India

MyWell is an application for data-driven insights of groundwater at a village level. MyWell crowdsources well level indicators from a group of connected farmers using SMS or a smartphone application.

This case study evaluates MyWell's implementation in 2 watersheds in rural west India. We demonstrate that MyWell can be used at multiple levels to enable data-driven farming at multiple levels of a "value chain", specifically for a better groundwater understanding to smallholder farmers. We also demonstrate how MyWell empowers low level stakeholders to be a part of citizen science, and actively involved in a solution to the groundwater problem.


## Potential Development Impact

- communities able to survive in the future
- improved sharing of resources
- empowerment of low-level farmers
  - contrast against typical narrative

Groundwater scarcity is a growing problem. MyWell can serve to combat this problem, and allow for farmers, along with communities of farmers

This allows for short-term better allocation of water (ie. so crops won't fail), and long term steps towards ensuring the future livelyhoods of farmers.

Beyond groundwater, the MyWell approach also has potential to impact other aspects of ___ in resource-scarce environments.

We see MyWell as a platform for sharing water knowledge, and allow for grassroots citizen science to take place. The typical narrative of groundwater conservation is a top down approach; well informed research leads to recommendations to farmers to use less groundwater; advice that often goes unheeded. The MyWell approach is the opposite. MyWell allows for farmers to engage in science, and see for themselves the groundwater scarcity problem. This allows them to make their own decisions to share groundwater, and combats the tradgedy of the commons.



## Recommendation for future research

- scale up? apply at a wider level?
- apply this principle to other scarce resources?
- expansion (currently seeing pilot stage in Laos)
- integration with other tools (CGMN?)
  - MyWell's users are mostly low-level farmers, but these tools are useful for other areas of research


While this study evaluates MyWell's use in 2 watersheds in rural India, MyWell is not limited to these places, or even India. Future research should apply MyWell to other countries and groundwater situations...

MyWell also has considerable network effects; the more wells being monitored with this technology, the more valuable the information gathered is, and the more insights for data-driven action it can deliver across multiple stakeholder levels.

We also would see MyWell integrate with existing tools to allow for more researchers. We are currently planning an integration with CGMN... This increases the utility of MyWell for other groundwater researchers...





## TODO:
- look up other people's submissions for similar projects



## Extra bits:

Groundwater scarcity in Rural India is a growing problem, which disproprtionately threatens the livelyhoods of smallholder farmers. As a shared resource, groundwater management suffers the tradgedy of the commons. Pumping groundwater becomes a race to the bottom, at which point everybody loses...
__TODO - talk about overcommiting water, other issues...__
