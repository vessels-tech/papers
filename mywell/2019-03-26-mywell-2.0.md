# MyWell 2.0 Is here!
## [subtitle]


I've been working on the MyWell and MARVI project for the last few years. What started as a simple university side project turned into something much bigger and better, and we hope that this new version of MyWell will empower citizen science for groundwater management anywhere in the world.

“What’s MyWell” you ask? Feel free to read on, but the basics of what we’re doing with MyWell are here.

In short: MyWell is an app for crowdsourcing groundwater levels in rural India from groups of Groundwater informed volunteers, known as Bhujal Jankars (BJs) in Hindi. MyWell aims to engage everyday villagers in groundwater science, and helps to build communities that are resilient in the face of groundwater scarcity and climate change.

I started laying the groundwork for MyWell 2.0 during my trip to Gujarat and Rajasthan in January 2018 (you can read all about it [here](https://medium.com/vessels/water-wells-and-workshops-69b540efe58e)). In this trip, we saw some clear usability issues with the current version of MyWell, as well as a few things that would need to change in order to make MyWell scalable beyond just India.

Uunfortunatley this meant leaving behind the old, legacy code. It also meant dropping support for MyWell on Web, since supporting that was taking too much time away from working on MyWell on Android - besides, the farmers were definetly not using MyWell on Web.


## New Features

What's new? There's a whole lot that's new.

### Translations

This is by far the most important and obvious feature. MyWell 2.0 adds support for multiple languages, and even the ability to support new languages without needing a new app update. This means that in data scarce environments, users don't need to install large app updates [finish]

We currently support English, Hindi, Gujarati, and are working on French, Spanish and Afrikans support at the moment. If you want to see your language in MyWell, get in touch with me at lewis [at] vesselstech [dot] com, and we can make it happen.


### Simplified User Experience

Not everybody knows how to read a map. This might sound obvious to you, but it took me a while to understand this. With MyWell 2.0, we hide the map behind a browse button so as to not overwhelm our users who are less aquainted with maps.

What takes centre stage is our 4 measurement types: Groundwater, Check Dams, Rainfall and the newly added Water Quality. If you don't need to read a map, great, all the more easy for you to

Additionally, we noticed that people had trouble saving and remembering the names or IDs of what wells or other stations they recently visited or looked at. In MyWell 2.0, we've introduced a new "Favourites" and "Recents" feature. When you scan a well using a QR code, or look it up on the map, it gets added to your recents list, to make it easy to find again. You can also save wells to a favourites list so they are always easy to look up.


### Offline and new users are first class

We don't want there to be any barriers to users making important groundwater measurements for the communities. For that reason, we have improved the features for offline users and users who are just using the app for the first time. MyWell works completely offline if needed, and new stations and measurements can be saved to the MyWell system whenever the user reconnects their WiFi or mobile data.

Additionally, users who haven't yet been approved by administrators don't need to wait to save their readings. They can go ahead and make as many readings as they would like, and once their account is approved, their readings will be saved and shared with other MyWell users.

### Better Reading Verification

One question we are often asked about our crowdsourced data is, "How do you know that your data is accurate?". While in our studies we have shown the trustworthyness of the BJs for the most part, we have now added location tagging and image uploading when users submit readings. This means we can have an audit trail to make sure the user was close to the well or station when taking a reading, and look at an image to verify their reading was correct.


### QR Codes

One of the issues we saw with MyWell being used in the field was the many different names for one well. Wells had different ids from the MyWell system, to the local watershed, to the BJ just knowing it by the owner of the well. Taking a leaf out of PayTM's book, we added support for QR codes in MyWell. This means we can print and laminate a QR Code and attach it to a well, or even share wells from one MyWell app to another using the QR Code scanning feature.

There are many more features that we have bundled into MyWell 2.0, and we can't wait to see how they are recieved by our users as a whole. You can download MyWell for yourself [here](insert link).
