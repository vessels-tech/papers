## MyWell SMS
Two of the key MyWell tools are available over SMS as well as through the MyWell app; Recording a new reading, and querying a Well, Checkdam or Raingauge for information.

### Phone Numbers

MyWell has a numbers in the following countries:

| Country       | Number|Service Code
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:
| India         | `+91 97655 56555`| MYWL
| Laos          | `coming soon`| *none*
| Australia     | `coming soon`| *none*

You can send messages to any of the above MyWell numbers.


### Message Format
In order for MyWell to understand the message, the user must follow a strict messaging format.

The format for these messages starts as follows:
```
[<SERVICE_CODE> ]<MESSAGE_CODE>
```
where `<SERVICE_CODE>` is the optional code specifying the service. The default for MyWell is `MYWL`.

>*A note about SERVICE_CODES*
Service codes can serve a dual purpose in the MyWell system. In India, SMS providers share 1 number between many customers. As a result, users are required to specify a code at the start of the SMS, in order to get the message routed to the correct place.

>For deployments of MyWell in other regions, this may or may not be required, but this design decision gives us the ability to share numbers between multiple deployments of MyWell, if this is required in the future.

#### Message Code

`MESSAGE_CODE` is a code denoting the type of message the user will be sending. They are:

| `MESSAGE_CODE` | Method |Description
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------
| `S`         | saveReading| saves a new reading.
| `Q`          | queryResource| queries an existing resource. This can be by postcode, village, or individual resource.

- `S` - saves a new reading.
- `Q` - queries an existing resource. This can be by postcode, village, or individual resource.

#### saveReading Format:

The format for a saveReading request is as follows:

```
S <POSTCODE>/<RESOURCE_ID>/[<DATE>/]<READING>
```

>*Note:*
`<DATE>` must be in a YYMMD format, and is optional. If not specified, the reading will default to the current date.

#### saveReading Examples:


- `MYWL S 313603/1501/3000`
"for the service MyWell, save a reading of 3000 units for the resource 1501 in postcode 313603"


- `MYWL S 313603/1501/170101/3000`
For the service MyWell, save a reading of 3000 units for the resource 1501 in postcode 313603 for the 1st of January, 2017


#### queryResource Format:

```
Q <POSTCODE>[/<VILLAGE_ID>|/<RESOURCE_ID>]
```

Where:
`<POSTCODE>` is the postcode containing the resources.
`<VILLAGE_ID>` is a 2 digit ID referring to a group of resources
`<RESOURCE_ID>` is a 4 digit ID, specifying a specific resource within a village. The first 2 digits of the resourceId are the villageId.


#### queryResource Examples:

**Query a Pincode:**

message: `MYWL Q 313603`
"For the service MyWell, get the report for the resources in postcode 313603"

response:
>For pincode 313603, the average depth to water level is 45.54m.

## Getting Data in and out of MyWell

MyWell allows you to export your readings into a tsv format, which can be read by Excel or Google Sheets. The export has a limit of 10,000 rows. If you need to export more than this number of readings, contact support for other options.

The url for downloading readings is:
```
https://mywell.vessels.tech/api/readings/exportReadings?pincodes=<pincode list>"
```

where `<pincode list>` is a list of postcodes you want to get the reading data for, separated by commas.
For example, to get the readings from postcodes 313603 and 313604, you would use the url:
```
https://mywell.vessels.tech/api/readings/exportReadings?postcodes=313603,313604"
```

*note: For postcodes with lots of readings, please be patient! It can take a while to download all readings.*

### Google Sheets

You can use the `IMPORTDATA` function in google sheets.

1. On a new sheet go to cell `A1`, and press `=`
2. Enter the function IMPORTDATA(<url>), where <url> is the url for the readings you want to download
3. The table should load sucessfully. If it doesn't load, make sure that your url is formatted correctly.

You can see an example of this working here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D-SNQevbVzt5Nks2rLOlehaxQDpeujNdkBzdYTGlMgQ/edit?usp=sharing

Feel free to copy this spreadsheet, and change the postcodes to the postcodes you require.
