## MyWell

## Introduction

The aim of this paper is to outline the process of developing and implementing mobile phone technology for villages in rural India and evaluate its potential for assisting sustainable groundwater management.

India uses the largest amount of groundwater in the world, estimated at 230 __?__ per year (World Bank, 2010). Groundwater is a relatively cheap and accessible resource, which contributes to its over exploitation. As it is shared among a watershed, the property rights of groundwater are difficult to manage, as whoever pumps first owns the water (Maheshwari et al, 2014; Chinnasamy, Maheshwari and Prathapar, 2015). Groundwater is often overexploited for food production, with rainfall insufficient to recharge the groundwater levels (Rathore, 2004)

Groundwater is fundamental to the livelihoods of many farmers across India. In rural India, over 60 percent of agriculture is dependent on groundwater irrigation (World Bank, 2010). It allows farmers to grow crops in the dry season, as well as manage deficiencies in monsoonal rainfall, contributing to improved livelihoods and poverty alleviation (Maheshwari et al, 2014).

In order to better manage groundwater usage, intervention is required; both technological and social. Infrastructure is required to better facilitate aquifer recharge, and social frameworks are required to better manage groundwater use and sharing.  The MARVI project, Managing Aquifer Recharge and Sustaining Groundwater Use through Village-level Intervention, aims to address this situation around groundwater management, by developing a participatory approach and methodology with tools to assist in groundwater management (Maheshwari et al, 2014).

The goal of the MARVI project is to give the ownership of groundwater situation to the villagers, and assist them in developing their own solutions to the issues they face. This process is being fostered through engagement with the community; helping them to understand and own the groundwater issues, and technology, namely in the collection and dissemination of information, allowing for a greater understanding of this invisible resource.

In order to develop frameworks for improving the groundwater situation, accurate well data and sociological data are required.  While the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) data are useful for groundwater monitoring on a national level, they are limited when applied to groundwater management at a village level. MARVI aims to collect more granular data, to better understand and apply to the issues directly to villages. MARVI also conducted studies on the socio-economic aspects of groundwater management. Collecting accurate groundwater data is important, but understanding the attitudes towards groundwater management for each village will allow for MARVI to better apply solutions.

MARVI engages the community through water table monitoring, crop demonstrations, workshops, education in schools (Maheshwari, 2014). The goal of this is to foster community awareness around groundwater usage and depletion, and to create a platform for further discussion on improving groundwater management.  Community engagement is also achieved through the Bhujal Jankaar program. Within each village, a volunteer known as a Bhujal Jankaar (BJ) has been trained to monitor wells, and act as a connection between MARVI and each village. They are able to disseminate information on rainfall and groundwater conditions, based on their water table monitoring work. They also play an important part in gathering together village communities for meetings, workshops and demonstrations.

India has experienced exponential growth of mobile phones and almost every household has at least one mobile handset for communication (__TODO: REF__). With the availability of mobile phones brings their application to help village community to monitor the local resource such as groundwater and develop longer term strategies for village level water security.

## Citizen Science in Action

Crowdsourcing is the approach of collecting data from a large number of distributed people. The growth of information technology has simplified crowdsourcing, and allowed for more novel applications, such as in citizen science. Citizen science is when amateurs are actively involved in science; through their contributions, a certain field of science can progress. Crowdsourcing for citizen science is being used to go beyond the boundaries of traditional scientific study, such as budget or time constraints, and is opening up new ways for everyday citizens to be involved.

Citizen science is not a new practice; it has been performed for many years. Technology is opening up new approaches for citizen science to take place. One of the oldest and longest running examples of citizen science is the Audobon Society’s Christmas Bird Count, started in 1900 (Audobon, 2015).  The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has used citizen science for geological surveys for over 100 years (Quinn, press).

An example of using mobile applications for crowdsourcing citizen science is IBM’s Creekwatch. Creekwatch is a crowdsourcing tool which collects qualitative data; text and images about waterways across 25 countries (IBM Research, 2012).

Social.Water was a project for collecting stream data from 9 different locations in New York (Lowry and Fienen, 2013). Over a 10-month period, the system used text messages and emails to receive and process 150 measurements from citizen scientists in New York. The creators of this project write how the readings can be used to supplement readings where “telemetry or continuous recording are infeasible” (Fienen and Lowry, 2013). They also note that a secondary purpose to their project is community engagement.

Crowdsourcing citizen science is also being used to solve problems in developing countries. Agro-Met is a tool for providing farmers in rural Maharashtra localized weather predictions over SMS, helping them become more resilient in the face of climate change (Singh, press). This project uses 75 weather stations, and also involves a training component. It overcomes a number of challenges unique to crowdsourcing approaches in Low Income countries, such as a lack of 3G mobile infrastructure, language barriers, and community training. The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in India is using crowdsourcing to monitor water quality. Volunteers are given kits to test a number of water quality measures, and then use text messages to submit these readings. They are then processed and analysed, to calculate the water quality for individual villages (Toon, 2016).

## The role of citizen science in groundwater management

Decisions regarding the sustainable management of groundwater should be based on objective science. By connecting farmers and local community members with hands-on monitoring opportunities, we can begin a village level movement for groundwater security through producing and empowering local groundwater champions. Crowdsourcing is suitable for groundwater monitoring since data are to be collected frequently (weekly or fortnightly) from wells, checkdams and rainfall stations spread across the country. Further, the data collection process is simple; anyone can learn how to monitor a well, checkdam or rainfall station.

Since 2012, the MARVI team has worked in Rajasthan and Gujarat with farmers, schools and others in the village community to develop village level groundwater monitoring approach.  The idea of Bhujal Jankaar (BJ), a Hindi word meaning ‘groundwater informed’, was developed to assist in monitoring of groundwater levels around villages, collecting local data and developing scientific understanding of groundwater dynamics.   The data collected by BJs can inform sound decision-making about the sustainable management of groundwater. MARVI helped to empower BJs, schoolchildren and ordinary citizens to collect valid and valuable scientific data related to their local groundwater situation, while providing those individuals with unique experiences, insights and access to leading groundwater researchers.

Our aim is to demystify groundwater science at the village level, making it accessible to villagers, government agencies and NGOs, while ensuring that it is cost-effective, evidence based and helps to groundwater situation at village level and beyond. The MARVI approach provides villagers the opportunity to work alongside researchers and government agencies.

The data collected by BJs are critical to build an understanding of how the groundwater levels fluctuate during the monsoon and other times of the year when pumping is in full swing. Also, local data collected this way can help us understand how we are impacting the groundwater situation at the village and inform sound decision-making about the management of groundwater.

Involving villagers for groundwater monitoring enables them to make a direct contribution to scientific research in their village, gain new insights based on sound data, and learn new ways to cope with groundwater scarcity. Also, involving villagers in groundwater monitoring provide immersive experiences that can help challenge current groundwater management practices. Ultimately, citizen science allows for more research to be accomplished globally and connects people in a worldwide environmental movement.

## Study Area

The development of MyWell is piloted in two watersheds, the Dharta watershed in Rajasthan and the Meghraj watershed in Gujarat (Figure 2). In both watersheds, groundwater is the main source of irrigation water supply and plays an important role in agriculture and the livelihood of people. Both districts are in hard rock aquifer areas and groundwater levels have dropped significantly due to excessive pumping. MyWell is designed to be used in any part of India or in other parts of the world with a slight modification.

### Rajasthan

The study area of this project, the Dharta watershed, in Rajasthan is located in the Udaipur district, one of the 33 districts of the state. This district has about 2500 villages with population of 3 million and some parts of the district are predominantly tribal. The district is drained by the Sabarmati River in the west, the Banas River in the north and east and the Mahi River in the south and central parts. Agriculture plays a major role in the livelihoods of villagers but farmers often face Kharif crop failure due to the lack of rain at a critical stage of the crop growth.

The soil type in the district is sandy loam to clay loam and the topography is often undulating. The average rainfall of the district is 650 mm, and about 128,000 ha of land is under irrigation with 89,000 ha mainly dependent on groundwater. The Dharta watershed is about 55 km east of Udaipur city.  The main Kharif crops in the Dharta Watershed are maize, pulses, sorghum, guar, soybeans and the Rabi crops are wheat, barley, chick pea and mustard. For irrigation they mainly depend on open wells or tubewells but a large proportion of open wells have dried up or they are not reliable as source of water supply. Many farmers have gone for tubewell to a depth up to 150 m but they are also not so reliable these days as they can also dry up during summer months or during drought years.

The surface method of irrigation is widely used but some farmers are going for sprinkler and drip systems as there is a government subsidy on the cost of installation of these systems. The source of drinking water in all the villages is groundwater and it accessed through hand pumps, open wells or tubewells. Hinta village has piped water supply to most homes from a village overhead water tank constructed by the Government. Recently, a village overhead tank was constructed in Dharta village but most homes do not have piped water supply yet. Families in Sunderpura rely on hand pumps for their domestic water supply.

### Gujarat

The study area in Gujarat is located in the Aravali district, the 29th district created in 2013 and lies north of Ahmedabad. It has about 650 villages with a total population over 1 million. The district is drained by the Sabarmati River in the west, the Banas river in the north and east and the Mahi River in the south and central parts. The Aravalli district has a large tribal population with approximately 30% of the population coming from socially and economically disadvantaged groups.

The soil in the district is loamy type with topography undulating. Unlike other districts in the state, about 80% of rural livelihoods are dependent mainly on agriculture and dairying and the district does not have many industries or urban centres. Average rainfall of the district is 750 mm, and there are 444,000 ha under irrigation with 170,000 ha dependent on groundwater through dug and tube wells.

The Meghraj watershed is located about 25 km west of Modasa town and 100 km from the state capital Gandhinagar. In this watershed also, agriculture is quite important in the livelihoods of villagers and the threat of Kharif crop failure is always there if there is insufficient rainfall at some stage during the monsoon season. The main crops grown in the district are maize, cotton, wheat, pigeon pea and castor. The soil type in the district is sandy loam to clay loam and the topography is often undulating. The average rainfall of the district is 750 mm, and about 444,000 ha of land is under irrigation with 170,000 ha mainly dependent on groundwater.
