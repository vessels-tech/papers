Hi Basant,

The brochure is very impressive. I made a some few corrections. What I thought would add is a link to a video or something explaining a process of uploading/using the MyWell app. I think the video can be done fairly quickly, and uploaded before the workshop. So, when someone reads the brochure, they can actually key in the link and view how it is used, like a demo.

attached are a few comments.

Yours Sincerely
Pennan Chinnasamy

Hi Basant,
Looks good.
I continue to dislike all the heavy background colour as its wasting printer ink for nothing.
Some suggestions:



P3 the screenshots on the right don’t relate to the screenshots at the left.  These should be consistent and be more interesting and obvious (like the bottom figure).  Perhaps the two wasted upper figures could be omitted and lower down show a screen shot of map of water table depth, or a history of raingauge readings..  just an idea..


P3 para 3 3rd para .. admins ?  and paragraph is cut short.
P4 para 1 : MyWell will be scaled from 10 to 100 villages, onto several orders .. suggest.. MyWell will be scaled from 10 to 100 villages, then onto several orders of magnitude larger.

The brochure contains nothing about quality control.
If you are going to allocate groundwater / rabi plantings on basis of average water table depth compared with past, then all farmers may report higher levels than they have measured.  They could use MyWell to cheat.  Perhaps mention on page 4 that data quality checking will be one of the new features to be developed.  (Eg For check dams and raingauges it can be backed up with a photo.  For my well there may need to be a government person who randomly checks wells in an area and their data will get uploaded and plotted in a different colour or feature to identify.)

Another feature that could be added in future could be information on concentration of fluoride or other targeted contaminants.  Where measurement equipment is available and calibrated.

Thanks for making it depth to groundwater level and keeping depth of well out of it.

Looks useful,
Regards,
Peter

Hello Sir,

The brochure is looking very good. I have one suggestion on page 3 “…..Finally, MyWell allows admins to upload a large number of readings at a time. This allows an import of large amounts of historical data; increasing the immediate value of…. …” I think due to size of textbox some text from this para is hiding under it.

One suggestion is if its ok we can share one photo like in which farmers photo with village number and 3 years well hydrograph can be visible. It can go in historical data section.

Lewis – Can you we follow up Peter’s suggestion about a screen on Rainfall data and some other points and Pennan’s suggestion about a short instructional video.

As a way to get some feedback from people at the workshop, we will have some recent data from the BJs and ask the app evaluators to upload them on the spot and then give some feedback.

Best wishes,

Basant
