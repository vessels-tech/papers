# The case for Long Tail NLP
## A dive into some current use cases for low resource NLP.

In my [last post](https://medium.com/vessels/the-long-tail-of-nlp-9f4997149375), I talked about the gap in NLP tools for high vs low resource languages. As internet adoption grows worldwide, there will be more and more consumers who use these low resource languages. [finish theseis summary]

Indeed, we are seeing some of this technology appearing right before our eyes. Google recently announced beta support for 7 new Indian languages [1] as well as support for Voice typing on KaiOS phones (KaiOS is a phone operating system for smart feature phones in emerging markets). I suppose that's what a $22m investment in the company buys you.

So it's clear that Google has identified the need to support low resource languages, but are there some other cases where we can see NLP 

And my question is: how do we make these tools accessible to others in a way that isn't owned by Google? [improve]


In this post, I'm going to take a look at 3 of the existing use cases for NLP in low resource languages. [more]


## 1. UMATI - Monitoring Hate Speech In Kenya

UMATI is a platform which monitors hate speech in Kenya. Kenya has a violent past when it comes to hate speech inspired violence, [more]

UMATI started by manually collecting and categorizing forms of hate speech online across 7 different languages. 

- While the initial scope of the project isn't 
- They have begun work on phase 2, which involves using their corpus to train Machine learning models to automatically classify hate speech scraped from the web.


## 2. Well Told Story - Monitoring and Evaluation

- "Well Told Story uses 'rich-multimedia' [wtf?] to engage Youth in Tanzania and Kenya around social and economic issues" [2]

- Their main tool for such outreach is through their Shujaaz mega-platform: spanning comic books, radio shows and social media campaigns
- Youth interact with this media using Sheng, an English and Kiswahili slang language spoken by many youth.

These engagements are growing, and WTS needed the ability to understand how users were engaging through their outreach to the tune of 100,000 messages a month. This led them to partner with Africa's Voices to build a NLP platform that analyses these messages in real time, specifically with:

- two approaches:
1. classify messages by their topic
2. sentiment analysis


>"With these tools [Well Told Story] will be able to track SMS conversations in response to their media in near time and measure the sentiments in these conversations, allowing them to ascertain if increased engagement is leading to positive shifts in social norms." 

In addition, WTS also expanded on these tools with the help of BFA to understand the Kenyan young entrepeneur culture [3], in order to tailor services and programmes to support them.
  - Gathered data from their facebook campaigns and communities.
  - basic clustering anonymysed users based on their language and interests
  - Can then be fed into other programmes to help support these 'hustlas'

## In Summary

While these are just 3 examples of where NLP can be applied in low-resource languages (and just in East Africa as well), I hope they demonstrate the potential for building such NLP tools for low-resource languages in emerging markets. 

Do you know of other use cases that might be interesting? Feel free to share in the comments below.

This post is part of my research on the business potential for building natural langauge processing apis in emerging markets. We at Vessels Tech are actively researching this topic and building out our initial prototype. If you are interested in working together, feel free to get in touch at lewis [at] vesselstech [dot] com. Cheers!
