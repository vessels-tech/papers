Automation & Development: Some thoughts

As ___ writes, the first three 'industries' were hallmarked by the innovations of:
The Factory
The industrial line
Outsourcing manufacturing to countries with cheap labour
Automation

TODO: reference The bottom billion, and the role of 3rd industrial revolution in economic development.
In my country of Australia, we are still reeling from the loss of our manufacturing to countries like China, etc. Our unemployment is at x%, and the thought that more automation could increase that is simply terrifying. It's safe to say (as planet money episode __ says) the western world is not very good at adjusting to a service-based economy.
Even still, automation and the 4th industrial revolution paints an even bleaker picture to developing countries that have seen such growth in the last 30 years.
//TODO: talk more about this


How about Japan? Can we draw some interesting conclusions here?
What can be done in Low income Countries?
Paul Chapman anecdote
Conclusion? Dunno. Is there hope? Dunno
