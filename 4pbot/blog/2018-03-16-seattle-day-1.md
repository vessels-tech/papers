How I pitched my project at the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.

[insert image of beers or something?]


## Background

DFS Lab are an investor-slash-incubator, who focus on improving access to financial services for the poor. They have a wide ranging portfolio across [finish sentence].

In 2017, DFS Lab put out the call for 2 challenges - biometrics and chatbots. The biometrics challenge was focused on enabling for fingerprint identity using basic Android smartphones, and the chatbot challenge was around helping people in disadvantaged communities navigate and access complex bueracratic processes. [talk about these things being enabling technologies in the digital financial services space]

At Vessels Tech, we've been working on 4PBot, a chatbot to help people understand and navigate the social welfare system in the Philippines. We won't cover much more about it in this post, but you can find out more information about 4Pbot here:, and read my other posts introducing it here:.

This conference was a summary of the work undertaken by teams for both challenges, where we presented our results, and hopes for the future of these projects. At the Bill & Melinda Foundation (or, just the "Foundation" for those in the know), we presented our work in the chatbots challenge to the Financial services for the poor team.


## What I learned

I learned a whole lot during my trip. My key learning was the ability to get a sense of how the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation works. In particular, I came to understand the sheer scale that the Foundation works on - they tend not to work with small proofs of concept, or pre-seed projects.

A key take away was this: at Vessels Tech, in order to see our work succeed and thrive within these big systems, we need to leverage players like the foundation to help us get our foot in the door. As the director of DFS Lab, Jake Kendall, said, we now have a pretty good proof of concept to do this, as opposed to waiting 5-10 to go through the procurement cycle.

Being in the room with important decison makers at the foundation, other technology-for-development founders and

Not only this, but we had the opportunity to present our work in a lightning-round at the University of Washington. I was really able to get a sense of the excitement for what other founders are working on, and was inspired by their passion for seeing people's lives improved through better access to financial services.

I also had a great discussion with the DFS Lab guys about these very blog posts - and to my great surprise, it seems they actually read some of these. So I'm thankful that it's not just my Mum reading these things, and a shoutout to Jake, Alina, Stephen and Dan!


## Biometrics

- 2 teams
- I wasn't sure it was possible, but it sure as hell was!
- Use case focused on self-identifying (although field trials were more around 3rd party identification)
- A very focused, well defined challenge, with really promising results

There were two teams that presented their work on the biometrics challenge Diamond Fortress Technologies and Veridium. Since this was a very well defined project, both teams presented similar approaches [finish]. I was in fact quite skeptical of the ability for a basic Android smartphone to read fingerprints with a camera alone, but both teams presented solid, working products.

A highlight of these presentations was Veridium's demo of using their "four finger..." technology for multi-factor authentication.


## Chatbots

In stark contrast with the well defined parameters of the biometrics challenge, the chatbots challenge could not have been much more open ended. The benefit of this was that each of the 5 teams that presented each worked in different sectors, from mobile banking, Farmer advice, mobile money agent liqudidty, navigating immigration, and us, working on empowering individuals navigating welfare systems.

My favourite demo - and perhaps the favourite of all teams - was Mohit Jain's demonstration of his chatbot, KissanBot. KissanBot gives farmers advice about their crops, and does so using voice instead of text - making it much more accessible to users with low literacy.

Throughout the presentations, we discussed the tradeoffs between structure and unstructured conversation both from being able to offer advice and collect information from users in order to assist them. We also talked about how ubquitous the tools are for building chatbots, but the real challenge with seeing these programs be successful is the content.

My key piece of advice from the Gates team is that I needn't be afraid of the government. In building 4PBot, we opted only engage the Filipino government occasionally, as we were afraid to be shut down. Himahsu Nagpal [check], the deputy director of the financial services for the poor team at the Foundation encouraged me, and the other bot builders to not be afraid of government. They perhaps need to be wooed, and people like the Gates foundation and DFS Labs can help, but in order for the full impact of 4PBot to be realised, we *will* need govt support.


## Just Dreaming

In addition to the our presentations, we participated in a panel with Dan Radcliffe (no, not that one). Dan outlined a vision for the potential he could see in these technologies, in particular focusing on how chatbots can be used for open governance.

Chatbots could enable governments greater visiblity into programs - such as government-to-person payments - and go a ways to spot problems and identity fraud or corruption. This is something that lines up with the vision we see for 4PBot, so here's hoping that we might see this happen one day. The holy grail of these technologies could be allowing for citizen-centric governance, where citizens have a better say over what services they need, and can offer an extra level of oversight into [finish]. One example Dan outlined was for big public works, such as building a road. Instead of oversight being just from project managers and ___ , everyday citizens could use chatbots to report progress from their perspective, and keep the project managers and ___ accountable.

## Next Steps

One key outcome from the conclusion of this project is the chatbots community. DFS Lab is aiming to build together a community of bot builders who work on problems like these, in countries like these [rework]. We

- Chatbots community.

- do an IVR investigation
- apply for PHL Bank project
- Continue conversations about scale, and really focus our pitch on impact assessment
- pick up conversations in the Philippines where we left off!
