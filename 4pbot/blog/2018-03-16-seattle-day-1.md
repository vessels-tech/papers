# Seattle Day 1

How I pitched my project at the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.




## Background

2 sentences about DFS, work they are doing with BMGF. 2 Challenges background, why and who?


## What I learned
- BMGF are very big focussed
  - Good to have some projects that were almost completely left of field - pre-seed vs big existing systems
  - At Vessels Tech, we need to leverage players like the foundation to help us get out foot in the door. As Jake said, we now have a pretty good POC to do this, as opposed to waiting 5-10 to go through the procurement cycle.
- The DFS Labs like these blog posts, and encouraged me to do more! I'm thankful that it's not just my Mum reading these things. So shoutout to Jake, Alina, Stephen and Dan! (and old Dan).



## Biometrics

- 2 teams
- I wasn't sure it was possible, but it sure as hell was!
- Use case focused on self-identifying (although field trials were more around 3rd party identification)
- A very focused, well defined challenge, with really promising results



## Chatbots

- opposite, open ended challenge
- Teams working across sectors, in mobile banking, Farmer advice, mobile money agent liqudidty, navigating immigration, and us, working on empowering individuals navigating welfare systems.
- A lot of promise, learned much from other team's approaches
  - farm advice demo was amazing!
- We talked about the tradeoffs between structured and unstructured conversation
- The tools are out there, but the content is much harder.
  - [long tail languages] Something which struck me was the fact that these
- Don't be afraid of the Govt.! Thanks Himanshu


Dan Radcliffe Panel
- chatbots for open governance
- other notes?


## Next Steps

- do an IVR investigation
- apply for PHL Bank project
- Continue conversations about scale, and really focus our pitch on impact assessment
- pick up conversations in the Philippines where we left off!
