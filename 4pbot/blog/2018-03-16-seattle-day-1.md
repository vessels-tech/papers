# How to Pitch Niece Tech to Super Important People
## or, at least how I went about it, and what I learned.


[insert image of beers or something?]

In March 2018, I set out to present some of my work on 4PBot to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This whirlwind trip was full of nerves, excitement, and surprisingly for Seattle, sunshine. This trip marks the conclusion of our grant-suppoerted work on 4PBot, a chatbot to help people understand and navigate the social welfare system in the Philippines. We won't cover much more about it in this post, but you can find out more information about 4Pbot here:, and read my other posts introducing it here:.

## Background

DFS Lab are an investor-slash-incubator, who focus on improving access to financial services for the poor. They have a wide ranging portfolio across [finish sentence].

In 2017, DFS Lab put out a call for two technology challenges - biometrics and chatbots - areas which were identified by DFS Lab and the Gates foundation (who support DFS Lab) as two key enablers in helping low0income people access financial services. The biometrics challenge was focused on enabling for fingerprint identity using basic Android smartphones, and the chatbot challenge was around helping low-income people navigate and access complex bueracratic processes, typically those of big government programs like welfare systems.

This conference was a summary of the work undertaken by teams for both challenges, where we presented our results and hopes for the future of our work and this space. At the Gates Foundation, we presented our work in the chatbots challenge to the Financial services for the poor team.


## What I learned

I learned a whole lot during my trip. One key take away was a sense of how the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation works. In particular, I came to understand the sheer scale that the Foundation works on - they tend not to work with small proofs of concept, or pre-seed projects like the one I was presenting. Being in the room with important decison makers at the Gates Foundation, other technology-for-development founders and innovators was an exhilirating experience. It's experiences like these that often mark turning points in careers, vocations and lives.

Not only this, but we had the opportunity to present our work in a series of lightning-round talks at the University of Washington. I was really able to get a sense of the excitement for what other founders are working on, and was inspired by their passion for seeing people's lives improved through better access to financial services.

I also had a great discussion with the DFS Lab guys about these very blog posts - and to my great surprise, it seems they actually read some of these. So a shoutout to Jake, Alina, Stephen and Dan - I'm thankful that it's not just my Mum reading these posts.


## Biometrics

Two teams presented their work on the biometrics challenge: Diamond Fortress Technologies and Veridium ___ . The challenge was very well defined, in a nutshell: build an Android app that can read fingerprints with the camera only - no expensive attachments or ____. Before seeing their work, I was skeptical of the ability for a basic Android smartphone to read fingerprints with a camera alone, but both teams presented solid, working products.

A highlight of these presentations was Veridium's demo of using their "four finger touchless id" technology for multi-factor authentication. [add bits]


## Chatbots

In contrast with the well defined parameters of the biometrics challenge, the chatbot challenge could not have been much more open ended. The benefit of this was that each of the 5 teams that presented each worked in different sectors. We got to see a variety of approaches, across:
- mobile banking
- agricultural advice
- mobile money agent assistants
- navigating immigration, and
- empowering individuals to navigate social welfare systems (that's us!).

The envy of all the demos was Mohit Jain's slick demonstration of his chatbot, KissanBot. KissanBot gives farmers advice about their crops, and does so using voice instead of text, making it much more accessible to users with low literacy.

Throughout the presentations, we discussed the tradeoffs between structured, menu-driven interfaces for chatbots, and unstructured interfaces. We discussed the trust factor, and debated whether or not it was a good thing that many of our users didn't know that our bots weren't real people at first. We also talked about how ubquitous the tools are for building chatbots, but the real challenge with seeing these programs be successful is the content.

A key piece of advice from the Gates team is that I needn't be afraid of the government. In building 4PBot, we opted only to engage the Filipino government very lightly with what we were building, as we were afraid our project would be shut down. At the Gates Foundation, Deputy Director of Financial Services for the Poor, Himahsu Nagpal [check], encouraged us bot builders to not be afraid of government. They perhaps need to be wooed, and convinced about our approaches - which is where the Gates Foundation and DFS Lab can help - but in order for the full impact of 4PBot and others to be realised, we *will* need govt support.


## Just Dreaming

In addition to the our presentations, we participated in a panel with Dan Radcliffe (no, not that one). Dan outlined a vision for the potential he could see in these technologies, in particular focusing on how chatbots can be used for open governance.

Chatbots could enable governments greater visiblity into programs - such as government-to-person payments - and go a log ways to spot problems and identity fraud or corruption. This is something that lines up with the vision we see for 4PBot, so here's hoping that we might see this happen one day. The holy grail of these technologies could be allowing for citizen-centric governance, where citizens have a better say over what services they need, and can offer an extra level of oversight into what's happening at the ground level. One example Dan outlined was for big public works, such as building a road. Instead of oversight being just from project managers and ___ , everyday citizens could use chatbots to report progress from their perspective, and keep the project managers and ___ accountable. [rework]

In the case of government-to-person payments, citizens could use chatbots and associated tools to inform the government about what they need, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach. Citizens could opt for subsidys instead of cash payments or vice versa.


## Next Steps

One key outcome from the conclusion of this project is the inception of a chatbot-for-development [check] community. DFS Lab is aiming to bring together a community of bot builders who work on problems like these, in countries like these [rework]. We at Vessels Tech are excited to be a part of this community, and hope we can pass on some of our learnings, as well as learn from other approaches and ideas.

I've written elsewhere about the future of our project, 4PBot, but to summarize, I am keen to see it continue. We're going to be working on this, and the first step is for us to pick up where we left off in pursuing partnerships in the Philippines. We've also applied to the R2A chatbot competition to build a customer service chatbot for the Bangko Sentral ng Philippines [tidy]. With any luck, we will be able to apply our experience in the Philippines in this area as well.

In terms of longer term strategy, I'm quite happy for the scope to shift with 4PBot, and to apply it in other industries and/or countries. I believe there is great potential for this technology and approach in improving people's lives - now I just need to convince more important people that this is the case.

Until next time,




## extra bits that don't fit

A key take away was this: at Vessels Tech, in order to see our work succeed and thrive within these big systems, we need to leverage players like the foundation to help us get our foot in the door. As the director of DFS Lab, Jake Kendall, said, we now have a pretty good proof of concept to do this, as opposed to waiting 5-10 to go through the procurement cycle.
