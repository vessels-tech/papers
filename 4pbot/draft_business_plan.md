### B & A

#### Before:

	- only 1 chain of trust from 1 agency/department to another.    
- Power dynamic between DSWD and beneficaries

- lots of fraud


#### After:

- ...

### How it works:

1. User files report
2. 4Pbot anonomyses and releases to community
3. community provides advice/response/advice
4. 4Pbot helps user escalate to DSWD (using existing methods), and monitors the progress of the case
5. Aggregates reports and mines data etc
6. Produces report and sends to World Bank, etc.
