## How does it work?

### B & A
_todo: diagram_

#### Before:
- No 3rd party accountability
	- only 1 chain of trust from 1 agency/department to another.    
- Power dynamic between DSWD and beneficaries
- Hard for higher ups to connect with people at the bottom
- fraud is rife


#### After:
- 4Pbot as a trusted 3rd party
- enables safe place for beneficaries to talk about the issues they're having
- allows for
- ...

### Steps:

1. User files report
2. 4Pbot anonomyses and releases to community
3. community provides advice/response/advice
4. 4Pbot helps user escalate to DSWD (using existing methods), and monitors the progress of the case
5. Aggregates reports and mines data etc
6. Produces report and sends to World Bank, etc.
