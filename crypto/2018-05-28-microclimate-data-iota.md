# Microclimate Data on IOTA


Something I've been thinking about IOTA lately is the ability it affords for new data economies. I discussed this briefly in my post on the Streaming Data Payment Protocol ([you can read the post here](insert link)), but I wanted to expand on this concept in a more theoretical way.


## The State of IoT Data Today

The modern state of IoT data collection is incredibly vertically integrated,

- What is it?
- What can it be used for?
- How micro is micro


## New Economies Powered by IOTA

The machine-machine economy envisoned by the IOTA Cofounders is compelling. The idea of micropayments really opens up new opportunities, and IOTA is leading the charge with its fee-less approach. 

Fee-less micropayments reduces the overhead for each individual payment, and makes it 



Let's take for example the traditional cost of rolling out a single sensor,

## Subscription Models

Within this new framework of micro-payments, we could even imagine new pricing tiers. For example, imagine a data provider that produces

## Where to Start

So these models sound great! Where can I start? 

I'm really interested in applying this combination of technology, especially for contexts where microclimate data can be especially useful in improving people's lives. After all, that is the mandate of [Vessels Tech](https://vesselstech.com). 

I'm going to keep researching and exploring, and looking for customers, especially customer's whose needs overlap.
