title: From Dapp Zero to Hero in 5 days
subtitle: 
---

If you've read my previous [post](https://insertlink.com), you would know that I'm trying to pursure more a **deep work** approach in my everyday life.

This has been inspired by Cal Newport's book Deep Work - where basically says that the ability to focus in our everyday distracted world is akin to a *superpower*. One approach to attaining Deep Work nirvana is to turn off devices, disconnect from the world, and put your head down and work. It also helps, he explains, to set some goal that seems unattainable without a deep amount of focus and effort.

So in order to practice my superpower, I decided to set myself the goal of becoming an expert Decentralized Application (Dapp) Developer in 1 week. Here's what I did, what I didn't do, and how it went. Now I will mention that I have a passing knowledge of Blockchain and Ethereum, and I've been a Software developer for 8 or so years. At the start of this week, I had never written any Solidity, played around with any of the tools, or even understood what a Smart Contract was.


## What I did.

### Curriculum

I started by assembling myself a curriculum. While I saw that there were a bunch of online courses available, none really seemed to be better than what I could assemble myself, this is a brand new field after all.

My Curriculum was broken down into the following parts, one on each day:

- **Concepts:**
- **Skills:**
- **Practice:** Work through 2-3 tutorials that cover different Dapps. I chose to focus on 
- **Application:** Build a full stack Dapp project from scratch. I chose to build a basic decentralized reputation system. I might write a tutorial on it some time - let me know if you would want this in a comment below!
- **Next Steps:** Complete a detailed system design and architecture of a new Dapp. For this I chose to design something I'm working on for the Blockchain for Social Impact Coalition Incubator program. I would love to share more about it, but I need the blessing of my teammates first. Stay tuned.

You can find links to the books, tutorials and guides I followed [here](https://github.com/vessels-tech/papers/blob/master/other/2018-04-20-deep-work-approach-to-dapp-dev.md).

### Daily Summaries

At the end of each day, I wrote briefly what I had worked on, and any notes that stood out as important for a later date.

### Working Habits

I used the airplane mode on my phone extensively, to make sure I wouldn't be distracted by messages or crossword puzzles when I got bored. It sure helped to hone my focus.

I also broke my work down into 60-90 minute blocks. At the end of each, I would take a nice long break, make a cup of tea, or go for a walk. Working in these blocks helped me to know when to focus really hard, and when to rest.


## What I Didn't Do

Well this seems obvious, but in order to maintain my focus and commitment to deep work, these are the habits I normally do, but managed to stop for the week:

### Check my email every five minutes

This was really hard, but I think worthwhile. I even had an important email I was waiting on a reply from, but when I was in one of my deep working blocks, I didn't check my email and distract myself with irrelevant details.

### Use the internet when I didn't need it

I did this especially on the first couple days, when I was doing more reading and note taking than coding. This made sure I didn't find myself going down rabbit holes (which is very easy to do), and focus on the reading list I had set myself. Anything I was tempted to look up, I simply made a note of what I was curious about, and revisited it later on.

### Check Hacker News when waiting for things to download or build

I love Hacker News. And often it is my first port of call when I'm waiting for `npm` to install packages, or my code to compile. By resisting the temptation to get distracted at the first moment of boredom, I was able to stay focused on my tasks at hand, and get more done.


## How It Went

I was pretty happy with my progress. I managed to get a good understanding of Dapp Architecture, Solidity, Ethereum and IPFS. I managed to build a bunch of small projects, and designed a new dapp from the ground up.

I got distracted a little later on in the week, and (as always happening when playing with new tech) things took longer than I originally expected. This was especially the case with some outdated tutorials that simply wouldn't complile. I like to think spending the first couple days reading helped me to debug these issues faster than my usual brute-force approach.

So maybe I'm not quite an expert. But I daresay I'm only 1 or 2 projects away from being a reasonable Dapp developer, since this is such a new field.
