## Eth Hackternship Investigation



Notes:

Wishlist for future grants

Ref: https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/05/02/announcing-may-2018-cohort-ef-grants/

In future rounds of grants, we would like to see more applications in these areas:

    Scalability
        Alternate sharding implementations
        Alternate plasma implementations
        Improving efficiency of existing clients such as geth & parity
        A tokenless “Lightning Network” for Ethereum
    Usefulness
        UX design studies to improve private key management and transacting in Ethereum
        Alternative wallet / client designs
        Tooling that improves developer experience
        Improved documentation & developer/user education videos
    Security
        Security audits for Solidity and Vyper
        Smart contract audits
        Tooling that prevents vulnerable code
    “Hackternships”
        You have a job (or school)? No problem! Suggest a problem you want to solve and we’re happy to fund a 10-week $10K externship for your spare-time working on Ethereum. Successful projects will be featured at a developer conference. We are also looking to hire and fund from this pool of side projects.


## ideas:


vyper?

### contribution to the Flint programming language

#### maybe:
- developer tooling


#### Prerequisites
- work on some existing issues and get some PRs done






## Result:

I think there is a real potential to get a Hackternship for contributing to Vyper. Before we do this however, we need to establish more of a name for ourselves, get aquiainted with some pain points, and work on a couple issues.

Perhaps next week we can:
- develop and deploy a simple test contract
- write 2 short blog posts/tuts about Vyper
- work on 2 different github issues

From there, we will be in a place to suggest a Hackternship to improve some aspect of tooling, and hopefully feed my family!
