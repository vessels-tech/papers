# Using IOTA to manage groundwater


I recently put in a proposal to build this PoC to the IOTA Ecosystem Fund. While I wait hopefully for it's approval, I thought I'd share the motivation and concept here as well. Perhaps you might have some insights or advice for me - or maybe you think it's a bad idea! Let me know in the comments or reach out to me on the IOTA discord `@lwilld`.


## What is GWIota?

Groundwater Iota, or GWIota, is a proof-of-concept groundwater managment system built on top of IOTA. 

**Groundwater, you say?**
Yes. Groundwater indeed. To be honest, I've never really noticed or cared much about groundwater until the last few years - but I can assure you that plenty of people care about groundwater every day. Every. Single. Day.

Look to Cape Town, which is facing the most serious drought in recorded history[fix to make accurate]. Or to West India, where I've been working for the last 2 years, building tech to help faciliate better groundwater management.

**OK. Let's back up a step.**
India uses the largest amount of groundwater in the world, estimated at 230 cubic kilometers per year, more than 25% of the global total (World Bank, 2010). A cheap and accessible resource, groundwater is often over exploited for food production, with rainfall insufficient to recharge the groundwater levels (Rathore, 2004).

Groundwater is what is known as a tradegy-of-the-commons problem. It's a scarce resource shared between many people, which is hard

## What can be done?

As we saw above, many of the issues (many, not all) around groundwater are a coordination problem. Economies are excellent ways to solve coordination problems. Take [find resource] for example, it's a scarce resource, which needs to be shared between many people in a town or city. The person using most of it will pay a higher price, and this price reflects the *cost imposed* upon her/his neighbours. 

Groundwater is not one of these areas, but what if it was? What if for every litre of groundwater my neighbour pumped, I was compensated fairly for cost he/she has imposed on me? That's what I want to build this project.


## Enter IOTA

Iota is unlike other cryptos as it allows for feeless transactions. This enables transactions on a much smaller scale than we have ever seen before [finish]

## Here's How it Works

## Want to learn more?

If you're interested in learning more about this project, read the draft whitepaper [here](insert link). Also feel free to get in touch with me at lewis [at] vesselstech.com, or on the IOTA discord chat at `@lwilld`. Like I said, I've got an application in with the Ecosystem Fund to help support this project, but should that not get funding, I'll be looking for other ways to get this off the ground.
