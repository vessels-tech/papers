# Blockchain Water Rights

After coming back from Unleash, I've been pondering the issues around cross-border water rights management. 


Questions:
- Can smart contracts on the blockchain make agreements easier to create? And easier to manage?
- What is the role of the citizen in all of this? In my work in groundwater management, I've seen the potential for training and unleashing citizen scientists on 

After all, this seems like something where the blockchain reality might just live up to the blockchain hype. First of all, blockchains are great where parties have to come together but don't want to trust one another. Secondly, [finish]


## But first, a survey:

- Tradeable water assets on blockchain
- "Water rights are illiquid assets" - I know this is true, but it sure is a funny statement
- Seems like these people actually buy the water rights, and then allocate them to whoever is holding the AQUA token
  - Still requires trust of AR Foundation LLC
- Not really sure about this one, code hasn't been touched in a while, and I couldn't see any updates on their roadmap
- and I found [elsewhere](https://medium.com/@impactchainlab/managing-our-water-supply-with-blockchain-46aaf0b7f530) that the project didn't generate enough interest, and the funds from the crowdsale have been returned.

- Australia looks like they might be ahead on this (as an Australian, I find this surprising)
- The current state of affairs with water rights in Australia is this "complicated systems make it hard for smaller players to invest in securing water rights" [1](https://www.originclear.com/pdf/20180216-GWI-Blockchain-Article.pdf). This also creates the need for intermediaries, which drives up costs etc.

WaterChain and Genesis seem to both be approaches for ensuring water quality of treated water on the blockchain.

- water treaties have been around for a long time, and are generally quite robust (Isreal and Palestine, India and Pakistan)
- "What is needed are workable monitoring provisions, enforcement mechanisms, and specific water allocation provisions that address variations in water flow and changing needs."


## Ideas

- using smart contracts, smallholder farmers can band together to buy water rights at a large scale
- can we replicate complicated contracts and adapt for other locations easily?
- citizen science for ground-level monitoring of water use and abuse?
