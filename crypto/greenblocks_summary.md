## GreenBlocks Whitepaper

Programmable Farmland

GreenBlocks is a decentralized marketplace which securely connects urban farmers with owners of farmable space and provides a funding mechanism for farmers to sell produce to communities, consumers or food retail.

## Background

The Problem/Pain Point

Unused farmable land: Owners of vacant lots without the necessary funds to develop the land are wasting an opportunity. GreenBlocks allows for landowners of serviced and unserviced agricultural land & spaces (rooftops, warehouses) to earn income from their land, or share in the ownership of an urban farm.

Low accessibility or high risk capital for small farmers: Starting an urban farm is expensive, and fraught with risk. Currently, the key industry bottleneck is funding, where real estate and land usually follows the funding. With GreenBlocks, urban farmers benefit from reduced risk exposure as they can get direct access to funding and secure future demand and cash-flow, without having to rely on intermediaries. 

High inventory risk for smallholder farmers: With competition from large scale agriculture operations as well as international trade, small farmers are exposed to large inventory risks, specifically for perishable produce. By offering purchase agreements with merchants and consumers, this risk can be reduced or even fully removed. 

Reduction of urban green space (& gentrification of communities and neighbourhoods): As cities are expanding, we see an increasing destruction of urban green spaces. While regulation and city planners are working hard to protect these, the influx of capital for real estate and commercial use of land often makes this difficult. GreenBlocks provides a decentralized tool for communities to come together and protect urban land, while making it useful and valuable. 

Why is blockchain needed to solve this problem?

Smart contracts: Details of rental agreements between landowners and urban farmers can be permanently and immutably recorded on the blockchain in the form of smart contracts. Whenever part of the contract is completed (e.g. landowner provides farmer access to land, farmer gives landowner crops), both participants can acknowledge it by sending a cryptographic signature to the smart contract.

Low transaction fees: Farmers can crowdfund for their operations and pay profit shares to landowners and investors without the need for high-fee trusted intermediaries. Decentralized crowdfunding provides capital for farmers who might have no other means of fundraising.

Proof of ownership: Blockchains provide an excellent method for proof of ownership of assets, such as lease rights, future profits and/or crops.

Reputation: Users of the platform can gain or lose reputation points based on their experience and history, through direct metrics such as “ratings”, as well as indirect metrics taken directly from the smart contracts. These reputations and history are immutable and can be transparently tracked on the blockchain. 

## What is the size of the market? What demographics will you serve? Which industries will you impact? Any concurrent trends? 

A 2008 study of the global potential for urban agriculture based on unused or underutilized urban land estimates urban agriculture to be worth $33 billion annually.

In addition to the direct benefits associated with urban farming, there are several “ecosystem services” associated with it, including the reduction of the urban heat-island effect, reduced stormwater runoff, nitrogen fixation, pest control, and energy savings. Taken together, these additional benefits make urban agriculture worth as much as $160 billion annually around the globe.

GreenBlocks is primarily targeting Millennials, who are the new heads of households and are changing the landscape of our food industry. While our stakeholders also include farmers and merchants, we believe in the power of community-driven purchase behaviour which can influence our food supply chains bottoms up. A study of over 18,000 people in 23 key countries found that in every country, over half of the people wanted to buy their food local. In 19 of those countries, the amount was two-thirds or more of the population. We are using blockchain technology to create a decentralized marketplace, which will enable the growing and buying of hyper-local food through urban farming.

Additional industries impacted are: food production & processing (agriculture), food distribution, food retail, and the restaurant industry.
